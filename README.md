# California Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices in California using the Random Forest Regressor model. The California housing dataset is a popular dataset for regression tasks, and Random Forest is a powerful ensemble model for predicting continuous values, making it a great choice for this project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California housing dataset, which includes various features related to housing districts in California. The goal is to predict the median housing price in each district based on these features.

You can find the dataset [here](https://link-to-your-dataset).

## Random Forest Regressor

Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning model that leverages an ensemble of decision trees to make accurate and robust predictions for regression tasks. It's well-suited for tasks like housing price prediction.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/california-housing-prediction.git
   cd california-housing-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Model**:

   Run the Random Forest Regressor model on the California housing dataset. You can find the code in `random_forest_regression.py`.

4. **View Results**:

   The results, including predicted housing prices and evaluation metrics, will be displayed.

## Results

The project provides insights into housing price prediction, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

## Usage

You can use this project as a reference for predicting housing prices with the Random Forest Regressor model. The code is well-documented and structured to facilitate easy understanding and adaptation for similar tasks.
